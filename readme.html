		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Quickly and easily build ships for the game Silent Death.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.ironcrown.com/?page_id=232">Silent Death</a> is a space combat miniatures game. This ship builder implements the Starcraft Design System found in Silent Death: The Next Millennium. You will need the rules to play.</p>
		<p>The focus is on automating record-keeping to ease the process of designing ships. Additional features such as limited record-keeping during play might be nice to have in the future.</p>
		<h2>Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Browser-based, no download required.</li>
			<li>Includes light, medium, and heavy fighters plus basic non-warhead weapon systems.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Future</h2>
		<p>There are plenty of features yet to be implemented:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>expanded magazines</li>
			<li>missiles</li>
			<li>torpedoes</li>
			<li>gunboats and larger ship classes</li>
			<li>ship options</li>
			<li>quirks</li>
			<li>Allowing multiple ship designs on a single page, to total points for building a squadron</li>
			<li>Changing from design to play mode to lock down designs and allow damage to be tracked</li>
			<li>Saving designs in cookies or local storage</li>
		</ul>
