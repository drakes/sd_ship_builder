## Description

Quickly and easily build ships for the game Silent Death.

[Silent Death][5] is a space combat miniatures game. This ship builder
implements the Starcraft Design System found in Silent Death: The Next
Millennium. You will need the rules to play.

The focus is on automating record-keeping to ease the process of designing
ships. Additional features such as limited record-keeping during play might be
nice to have in the future.

## Features

  * Browser-based, no install required.

  * Includes light, medium, and heavy fighters plus basic non-warhead weapon
systems.

## Future

There are plenty of features yet to be implemented:

  * Missiles

  * Torpedoes

  * Gunboats and larger ship classes

  * Ship options

  * Ship quirks

  * Allowing multiple ship designs on a single page, to total points for
building a squadron

  * Changing from design to play mode to lock down designs and allow damage to be tracked

  * Saving designs in cookies or local storage

  * Encoding serialized designs to shareable URLs
